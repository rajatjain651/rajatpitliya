		<h3>These are some of the lessons that I have learned in my life till now and also would want my future self to remember: </h3>
		<br>
		<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		  <li>Don't be that Kharghosh, instead be that Kachua or if possible be a hybrid of both. Because life isn't a 100 m sprint it's a marathon that goes on and on.</li>
		  <li>To not underestimate anyone based on first impression/race/religion.</li>
		  <li>7 hours study on sunday or any other day for that matter < 1 hour study on each day in a week. There is a tiny differnce between both but if one scales this to a broader timeline let's say a year then the differnece is HUGE.</li>
		  <li>One can never know anything about what the other person is feeling or going through unless and until they are in the same situation/circumstances.</li>
		  <li>Death is the only constant so don't be afraid of taking risks and being judged because of failures.</li>
		  <li>Panic but panic early.</li>
		  <li>Always try to connect going backwardly</li>
		  <li>There is no correlation b/w the intelligence of a person and the language that he/she speaks, i.e. speaking English doesn't make someone a better human being.</li>
		  <li>A combination of skills like consistency, patience, dedication, perseverance, confidence and stability can make anyone a deadly Beast.</li>
		</ul>
