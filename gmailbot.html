		<h3>Automated Gmail Creation</h3>

		<p>This is a project that I did in march - april of 2021 don't remember the exact month. This project was part of a assignment during campus placements.
		<br>
		<br>
		In this short project I created a gmail account using selenium web driver and other third party python packages. You Can find the <strong>live</strong> video of it on Youtube <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJR8WS9ITe8">here</a>
		<br>
		<br>
		So the main goal was to create a gmail account with complete automation basically not doing anything manually. Although I did said the otp to the microphone but it couldn't be avoided ( to deal with fake accounts in my opinion).
		<br>
		<br>
		Here I used the 3rd party python packages like <strong>pyaudio and speech recognition</strong> to deal with audio inputs and then for conversion to text to be used by selenium web driver later.
